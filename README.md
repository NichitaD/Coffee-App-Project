# Mokka Project 

   The users of this app will be able to see a map of all the
coffee shops in their area and identify the one that's closest to them and
how to get there. It will also offer bartenders the possibility to organize
small contests for the coffee drinkers, and all kinds of promotions. The
difference between MOKKA and Google Maps is that it's tailored for people
who are avid coffee drinkers. The users will be able to keep track of their
coffee consumption, and always be informed about the latest promotions. 
These are some things that I implemented in this project so far :
 - Google Directions API
 - Google Maps API
 - Firebase Authantification and Database (CloudStore)
 - Review and rating system
 - Coffee consuption track system
